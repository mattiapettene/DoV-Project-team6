## Assignment 1 - Tyre fitting
In [this](https://github.com/mattiapettene/DoV-Project-team6/tree/main/Assignement-01-tyre_fitting) folder there are all the material related to the first assignment of the course, which aim is to fit the Pacejka MF96 tyre model coefficients on a dataset of measured forces for a F-SAE tyre. Using [Maple](https://github.com/mattiapettene/DoV-Project-team6/blob/main/Assignement-01-tyre_fitting/TyreModel-MF96.mw) the coefficients needed to fit the data have been extracted from the Magic Formula equations and the MATLAB functions collected in [tyre_lib](https://github.com/mattiapettene/DoV-Project-team6/tree/main/Assignement-01-tyre_fitting/tyre_lib) folder have been generated. The whole analysis have been carried out in [MATLAB](https://github.com/mattiapettene/DoV-Project-team6/blob/main/Assignement-01-tyre_fitting/main_tyre_data_analysis.m), starting from two different [dataset](https://github.com/mattiapettene/DoV-Project-team6/tree/main/Assignement-01-tyre_fitting/dataset). At the end, all the coefficents required by the MF96 tyre model have been obtained and collected [here](https://github.com/mattiapettene/DoV-Project-team6/blob/main/Assignement-01-tyre_fitting/tyre_coeffs_team6.mat).
